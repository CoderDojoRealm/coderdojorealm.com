# CoderDojo Realm Website

This project contains all the source files for the CoderDojo Realm website at http://www.coderdojorealm.com

## Structure

The project is intended to be super-simple, so we can use it for teaching kids how to build websites. 
To achieve that aim, the structure should remain super-simple.

At present, each page is at the root level, with any supporting assets in the 'assets' folder.
This makes it easy to understand, but will lead to code duplication (e.g. header and footer content repeats on each page), so watch out for that. 

## Github

The code is hosted at CoderDojo Realm's public github account: http://github.com/coderdojorealm. Please do not commit any sensitive information into this public repository.

## Client-only code

The website is hosted on a static hosting provider, so must remain client-only code.

## Supporting libraries

The site uses the following libraries:

- Twitter Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com 
- JQuery: http://www.jquery.com ÔúÅ

## Image copyright

The images are taken by volunteers from CoderDojo and all participants in these images have agreed to allow being photographed.

## Hosting

The site is hosted via GitHub Pages.  To update this, commit and push your changes into the ```master``` branch. Note that only the ```/docs``` folder is shared.
