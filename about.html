        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.coderdojo.com">CoderDojo</a> is a worldwide movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.
        </p><p>
            The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that it’s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.
        </p>
        <h3>CoderDojo Realm</h3>
        <p>
            CoderDojo Realm is not a classroom —  it is a free, fun community of children aged 7 to 17 who
            learn to code. The focus is on self-led learning with volunteer mentors offering assistance.
        </p><p>
            Our aim is to help our kids (called ninjas) to learn the concepts of computer programming,
            and to encourage interest, exploration and understanding of technology.
        </p><p>
            Ninjas learn by working on projects in an informal atmosphere, talking among
            themselves and working together. Mentors get involved only if the attendees can't
            solve the problem using the internet or by asking their peers. Ninjas are encouraged
            to choose projects that are of interest to them, rather than everyone doing the same
            project.
        </p><p>
            Parents are encouraged to sit alongside their children, especially younger ones,
            to learn as their child learns - this allows them to help their child take home
            their projects and help them to continue to learn at home.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to the kind support of
            <a href="http://www.erl.vic.gov.au">Eastern Regional Libraries</a>,
            <a href="http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au">Maroondah City Council</a>,
            <a href="http://www.yarraranges.vic.gov.au">Yarra Ranges Council</a> and
            <a href="http://www.knox.vic.gov.au">Knox City Council</a> for their
            ongoing support to run CoderDojo from <a href="http://www.realm.vic.gov.au/">Realm</a>.

        <h3>Mentors</h3>
        <p>
            A CoderDojo Mentor is a technically skilled person who guides dojo ninjas
            in their learning and project work. As a mentor, their aim is to facilitate
            learning, rather than teaching in a top-down fashion.
        </p><p>
            Mentors will focus on the ninjas' specific projects, but their
            aims are to develop independent research and self-learning skills rather
            than just having the ninja learn a particular technology.
        </p><p>
            When helping ninjas, mentors will try to guide them through online resources
            and try to point them in the right direction, rather than solve their problem
            outright.  Also, ninjas are encouraged to ask other attendees in the group
            for help, an to help others when they know something.

        </p><p>
            An important principle of the dojo is that we all learn together — 
            <strong>age is not an indicator of experience</strong>, and it's quite possible that
            a ninja knows more than a mentors on a particular topic.  We are all openly learning
            together in this fast-paced environment of Information Technology, and mastery of
            coding takes a lifetime.
        </p>

            <p>If you'd like volunteer as a technical mentor or a non-technical volunteer, then we'd love to talk — <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>!</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Ethos</h3>
        <p>
            CoderDojo encourages and supports an environment called <a href="https://coderdojo.com/start-a-dojo/coderdojo-echo-ethos-culture-happiness-and-outcomes/">ECHO — Ethos, Culture, Happiness and Outcomes.</a>
        </p><p>
            The overarching rule at Coder Dojo for both attendees and volunteers is <strong>be cool, learn together and have fun</strong>.
        </p><p>
            Coding is a really rewarding experience and lots of fun.
        </p>
